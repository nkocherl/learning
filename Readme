An ambitious goal:
  Start with fundamentals and go through the journey of learning and exploring machine learning and data science
  They say, if you do something for 21 days continuously, it becomes a habit
  I wish to make it a habit of mine to spend next 21 days dealing with data and learning machine learning with application.
  So, here's to a new start!
  
 Day 1 - 10 April 2019 - Start with basics: Linear Regression
